## Available time zone

The `tz` option takes the tz identifier from 2024b of the tz database.

[List of Time Zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) - wikipedia.org

If a specific time zone is not found, please consult your system administrator, as machbase neo relies on the operating system's tz database.

The well-known time zone abbreviations (e.g. UTC, Local, EST, CET, GMT) are also supported.
